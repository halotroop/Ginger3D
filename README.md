# Ginger3D
A [3D game engine](https://github.com/hYdos/Ginger3D) [based on Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) created by [hYdos](https://github.com/hYdos) <br/>
This game engine, with a little modification, is great for anything in Java. Not just voxel games. <br/>
It has been fully abstracted away from Litecraft (See below.)

# Litecraft
A voxel game implementation of Ginger3D with goals laid out in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yyfFVUmrdk9DTELSrxW7MLEw1srQVI8_nTBWZlentBQ/edit?usp=sharing) 
and several others. <br/>
This game can be found on [its own repo](https://github.com/halotroop/litecraft).
